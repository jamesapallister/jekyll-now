What to do next to grow the business: a technique to help prioritise and cut through the overwhelm

--

I'm quite good at making notes, and record keeping, so my ideas generally make it onto one of several trello boards.

What I find more difficult, is getting them all in one place, ordering and prioritising them.

One of the things I like about working on my own businesses, or with other small businesses, is the close feedback between where your next invocie is going to, or sale you'll make, and where you should be spending your efforts now. 

There's less of the unfoccussed chin stroking that can happen in larger organisations - some of it neccessary, bigger orgs require different ways of being - that you can't quite get away with in a leaner outfit.

That said, having the luxury of space to choose which move to take next is generally a positive sign you've leeway and 'fat' (the good sort) in your business, so it's a position to be aimed for, rather than sniffed at.

*My personal favourite example of focussed skin in the game is the Christmas tree salesman to do list in early december, but that's a different story. You're not allowed to do anything in the 'better' list until the 'basic' is covered. AKA the 'National Express - Easyjet - Private jet matrix'.

That all said, if the business is going well, you kind of want to be in a position where you're not in panic or response mode: and that means a bit of planning.

And once you move away from the important + urgent quadrant, there's generally a million possible tasks me and the team *could* be working on, but without good prioritisation, it's easy to find yourself with your wheels spinning, doing nothing fast.

**Cutting through the overwhelm**

Aside from the waste, this is emotionally taxing. Temperamentally I'm pretty comfortable with a high volume of inputs and ambiguity, but at some point it just gets too much*. 

I get overwhelm, and it's tricky to move forward. 

Which is why I'm making a note of the process we've used to prioritise today. I think it's been ruminating prompetd by some sketches earlier this week, but we finally nailed it today.

### Getting brutal on the backlog

Here's what we did. We took the view that most tasks fall into one of these categories:

1. Existing products: things we already do, photo shoots, pop up retail, space hire etc. 

2. New products: ideas we've got for more high concept or 'fiddly' stuff, courses, product shots as a service, subscriptions etc


If it's 2, we're gonna ignore it for the while. 

## Serenity through simplicity
Turns out, the combination of recording-yet-postponing the new ideas frees up a bit of headspace. Here's the thinking behind why we're trying to develop the bread and butter before moving onto fancy stuff. 

The shop is under-rented, and though the more conceptual stuff may be potentially more profitable and or more lucrative (they're different, I think), there's plenty custom we're leaving on the table by not having higher occupancy. 

So we're focussing on increasing volume of bookings at the moment. The more bookings, the more people see the space and experience it, the more enquires we get. And the more we do, the better our 'system' and skills can cope with more complex stuff.

It's either selling or serving 

Within that list of jobs associated with existing products (or new products, for that matter) pretty much everything fits into either:

1. Trying to get new customers to give you money(or new custom off existing customers)
2. Serving customers who are giving you money

Within '1', you can subdivide into 'Gaining leads' + 'Converting leads' but we're trying to keep it simple, so we won't bother. 

Serving customers encompasses anything that makes the experience better for the customer and increases the likelihood of this happening. 

This generally means protocols, systems and standard operating procedures, which in turn generally make life better and less stressful for us.

..or perhaps it's admin

Anything else which doesn't fit into the above, goes into:

	3. Keeping the lights on (the stuff that doesn't fit into the above categories)

This has things like 'Call UK Power Networks' and 'sort out radiator that's leaking gunge'. Arguably these could go in one of the 2 main categories, but we're not in this game to die in ditches.

So now we've got a much clearer idea of what we need to focus on, a smaller things to choose from, which makes it way easier to prioritise within those tasks.

I might try the coach;easyjet; private jet grid to further chunk down the tasks and whip up a more clearly prioritsed set of tasks that will help us cover the basics quickly, then gradually get fancier. 

But what about all those great ideas?!

Ah yes, ideas...

We're long on those, but like baby bears in captivity, they need contained and released at the right time. (Remember, we're trying to minimise overwhelm and ship stuff). 

One of the things we probably need to do next is 

	a) write out what it would entail, potential time / money / skills investment
	b) map them on a 'effort to do' vs 'money to gain' 2x2 and decide which ones we'd like to take forward
    c) decide how much capacity we have for new product development in a given quarter / half year and then allocate them accordingly.

It never goes to plan, but the plan still helps

So that's the process. Let's see how it works.

At least it's helped reduce overwhelm and suggest the next steps. 

I like ready reckoners and heuristics to not reinvent the wheel, so hopefully I can use this in other contexts. 

Like many one man bands, I'm trying to move from personalised services to standardised processes, all the while the big brands struggle to move the other way.


*Incidentally, my theory is that eveyrone has a set point of ambiguity they can cope with. This set point is plastic, and like a muscle, can be stressed (in a good way), developed and grown, but if there's a load of stuff up in the air in one part of your life, it may impact how much you can deal with in others.

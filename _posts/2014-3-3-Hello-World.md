Hello hello! I'm hoping to use this as a temporary container to get some regular writing habit down and actually publish some things.

Even though it won't help me win readers, I'm quite happy to be away from the whizziness and social feeds of Medium. Obscurity is fine for now. Though I have really enjoyed former colleagues Ella and Angus weeknotes there. Consider the shaming-into-writing to be alive Angus :). 

Hopefully I'll benefit from a bit of privacy until I hit my groove, and I can indulge my reluctance to give them content for free. Mainly this is a way of jotting down and capturing ideas, work stuff and generalities. To borrow a nice phrase from Giles: A [playground for ideas](https://gilest.org/2021/bad-first-drafts/#more-2239).

But tell us about the Tech Stack James! Well, it's a thing built with Jekyl that plugs into github, and I'm currently typing in prose.io. Clear? ðŸ¤”

Anyway, I put this together this evening after the kids had gone to bed, fumbling my way through github instructionals and listening to William Orbit, then Massive Attack, and finishing with Moloko.

Unlike my usual forays into code, it actually worked. And the focus required, coupled with a goldilocks level of difficulty - not too easy, not too sweary - made for a quite a pleasant few hours. Also, I quite like the idiosyncratic pairing of github-and-prose-as-a-CMS. 

It made me think of another Giles thing around all the [platforms he has used](https://gdsengagement.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/18/blog-like-there-arent-any-rules/), and how he prefers basic FTP-based blogging mechanics.

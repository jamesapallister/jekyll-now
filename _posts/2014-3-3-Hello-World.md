Hello hello! I'm hoping to use this as a temporary container to get some regular writing habit down and actually publish some things. 

I put this together in a few hours after the kids had gone to bed, fumbling my way through github instructionals. 

Unlike my usual forays into code, it actually worked, and was quite a pleasant process, focus-wise.

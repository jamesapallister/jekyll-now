I run a <a href="http://www.studiopallister.com">boutique studio</a> that helps clients with their storytelling, narrative and positioning and how to scale up their content offer. 

Much of my work is in central government, as well as working with clients in the private sector and local government. 

I'm also involved in building some speculative digital products.

This site is where I intermittently <a href="https://jamesapallister.github.io/jekyll-now/">blog</a>.

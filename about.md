I run a boutique studio that helps clients with their storytelling, narrative and positioning and how to scale up their content offer. We invest in, work on and build digital product and services. I also do a fair bit of work in central government, largely in content, as well as working with clients in the private sector and local government. 

### Some current projects

Helping small businesses sell more and take the risk out of starting to export at great.gov.uk
Making it easier - and more affordable - for small businesses and government agencies to run tree tests at treelly.com
Building a space on the high street to support small businesses at hostofleyton.com
